          station is equivalent to vector B and has an angle of 135° and the
          mass of 140 grams. The last station is equivalent to the third vector
          which has an angle of 282° and mass of 210 grams. Lastly, we observe
          that the three stations have balanced on the force table. Therefore,
          we have used the head to tail method of adding vector correctly.{" "}
